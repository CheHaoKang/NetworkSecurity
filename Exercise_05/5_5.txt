SHA3 has become a hashing standard since August 5, 2015.
SHA3 uses a different approach called "Sponge Construction" for hashing whose internal
structure varies from the other SHAs.

I choose SHA3-512 because:
1. It is the newest version of SHA
2. It uses a different approach called "Sponge Construction" for hashing whose internal
structure varies from the other SHAs.

Therefore, it is not easy for hackers to compromise the security of SHA3-512.
