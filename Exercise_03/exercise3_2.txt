Structure of a CPE Name

A CPE name is a URL that encodes seven ordered fields:

cpe:/<part>:<vendor>:<product>:<version>:<update>:<edition>:<language>

Some of the fields may be left blank, and empty fields may be left off the end of the URL. The main division of CPE names is in the <part> field; this can take on only three values:
a for applications,
h for hardware platforms, or
o for operating systems.

By looking at the beginning of the URL you can easily see that cpe:/a:microsoft:sql_server:6.5 names an application, cpe:/h:asus:rt-n16 names a kind of hardware, and cpe:/o:freebsd:freebsd:3.5.1 names an operating system.

Nmap can output all three kinds of CPE names: OS detection can print h and o; and service detection can potentially output all three. The CPE names are mixed in with normal OS and service output, for example:
